git config user.name dh****ju
git config user.email dh************ju@gmail.com

Notes 1:
--------
1. Created python_qanda folder locally.
2. Run git init, git config commands (above commands).
3. Created Readme.txt file locally in python_qanda folder and committed it.
4. Created python_qanda project (master branch) in github website.
5. Run 'git remote add origin https://github.com/dhanraju/python_qanda.git'
command.
6. Run 'git push -u origin master' command.
7. Now, we could see our file Readme.txt file in website.

Notes 2:
--------
1. Step 5 in Notes 1 (git remote add origin https://...) is only one time run
for the first commit. From second commit onwards, we dont need to run that
command. Just step 6 is needed after committing.
